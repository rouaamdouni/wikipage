    <h1>Art Periods – A Detailed Look at the Art History Timeline</h1>
    <img src="pic1.jpg" width="50%" alt="View of Vetheuil sur Seine (1880) by Claude Monet">
    <p>As long as we humans have been able to use our hands, we have been creating art.
        From early cave paintings to the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, human artistic expression can tell us a lot
        about the lives of the people who create it. To fully appreciate the cultural, social, and historical
        significance of different artworks, you need to be aware of the broad art history timeline. This article
        presents an overview of many significant eras of art creation and the historical contexts out of which they have
        risen .</p>

    <h2>Art Eras: Where to Begin?</h2>
    <hr>
    <p id="art-eras">As long as humankind has been conscious of itself, it has been creating art to represent this self.
        The earliest cave paintings that we are aware of were created roughly 40,000 years ago. We have found paintings
        and drawings
        of human activity from the Paleolithic Era under rocks and in caves. We cannot truly know the reason why these
        early humans
        began to produce art. Perhaps painting and drawing were a way to record their lived experiences, to tell stories
        to young
        children, or to pass down wisdom from one generation to the next.</p>

    <p>Although we have these exquisite examples of early artistic expression, the official history of art periods only
        begins with the Romanesque Era.
        Official art era timelines do not include cave paintings, sculptures, and other works of art from the stone age
        or
        the beautiful frescos produced
        in Egypt and Crete in around 2000 BC. The reason behind this decision is that these early eras of artistic
        expression were bound to a relatively
        small geographical space. The official art eras that we will be discussing today, in contrast, span across many
        countries, often all of Europe and
        sometimes North and South America.
        Despite their lack of official recognition, these earliest examples of human artistic flair raise a lot of
        interesting questions.
        Why is it that the animals depicted in cave paintings are so much more realistic and vivid than the animals
        represented in later eras?</p><br>
    <h2>A Brief Overview of the Art Periods Timeline</h2>
    <p id="brief">As with many areas of human history, it is impossible to delineate the different art periods with
        precision.
        The dates presented in the brackets below are approximations based on the progression of each movement across
        several countries.
        Many of the art periods overlap considerably, with some of the more recent eras occurring at the same time. Some
        eras last for a few thousand years
        while others span less than ten. Art is a continuous process of exploration, where more recent periods grow out
        of
        existing ones.</p><br>

    <p>It may seem strange for our account of the art period timeline to end 30 years ago.
        The concept of an art era seems inadequate to capture the variety of artistic styles that have grown since the
        turn
        of the 21st Century. There is a feeling among some art historians that the traditional concept of painting has
        died in our
        era of fast-track living. We do not take this stance. Instead, we continue to share our unique human experiences
        through
        the medium of art, just as the cave people did, outside of our modern system of classification.</p>

    <h2>The Romanesque Period (1000-1300): Sharing Information Through Art</h2>
    <p id="romanesque">Art historians typically consider the Romanesque art era to be the start of the art history
        timeline.
        Romanesque art developed during the rise of Christianity ca. 1000 AD. During this time, only a small percentage
        of the European
        population were literate. The ministers of the Christian church were typically part of this minority, and to
        spread the message
        of the bible, they needed an alternative method.Christian objects, stories, deities, saints, and ceremonies were
        the exclusive
        subject of most Romanesque paintings. Intended to teach the masses about the values and beliefs of the Christian
        Church, Romanesque
        paintings had to be simple and easy to read.</p>
    <hr>
    <strong style="color: rgb(97, 95, 99);">As a result, Romanesque works of art are simple, with bold contours and
        clean areas of color.
        Romanesque paintings lack any depth of perspective, and the imagery is rarely of natural scenes. There were
        several different forms
        that Romanesque paintings could take, including wall paintings, mosaics, panel paintings, and book
        paintings.</strong>
    <hr> <br>

    <p>Due to the Christian purpose behind Romanesque paintings, they are almost always symbolic. The relative
        importance of
        the figures within
        the paintings is shown by the size, with the more important figures appearing much larger. You can see that
        human
        faces are often distorted,
        and the stories depicted in these paintings tend to have a high emotional value. Romanesque paintings often
        include
        mythological creatureslike dragons and angels, and almost always appear in churches.
        At the most fundamental level, paintings of the Romanesque period serve the purpose of spreading the word of the
        bible and Christianity.
        The name of this art era stems from round arches used in Roman architecture, often found in churches of the
        time.

    <h2 id="gothic">The Gothic Era (1100-1500): Freedom and Fear Come Together</h2>
    <p>One of the most famous eras, Gothic art grew out of the Romanesque period in France and is an expression of two
        contrasting feelings
        of the age. On the one hand, people were experiencing and celebrating a new level of freedom of thought and
        religious understanding.
        On the other, there was a fear that the world was coming to an end. You can clearly see the expression of these
        two contrasting
        tensions within the art of the Gothic period.

        Just as in the Romanesque period, Christianity lay at the heart of the tensions of the Gothic era. As more
        freedom of thought emerged,
        and many pushed against conformity, the subjects of paintings became more diverse. The stronghold of the church
        began to dissipate.</p>
    <hr>
    <p style="color:rgb(97, 97, 96)">Gothic paintings portrayed scenes of real human life, such as working in the fields
        and hunting.
        The focus moved away from divine beings and mystical creatures as more focus was given to the intricacies of
        what it meant to be
        human.</p>

    <em>The Raising of Lazarus (1310-1311) by Duccio di Buoninsegna; Duccio di Buoninsegna, Public domain, via Wikimedia
        Commons</em>
    <p>Many historians believe that part of the reason why the subjects of art became more diverse during the Gothic era
        was due to the
        increased surface area for painting within churches. Gothic churches were more expansive than those of the
        Romanesque period,
        which is thought to represent the increased feelings of freedom at this time.
        Alongside the newfound freedom of artistic expression, there was a deep fear that the end of the world was
        coming. It is suggested
        that this was accompanied by a gradual decline in faith in the church, and this in turn may have spurred the
        expansion of art outside
        of the church. In fact, towards the end of the Gothic era, works by
        Hieronymus von Bosch, Breughel, and others were unsuitable for placement within a church.
        We do not know many individual artists who painted in the Romanesque period, as art was not about who painted it
        but rather the message
        it carried. Thus, the move away from the church can also be seen in the enormous increase in known artists from
        the Gothic period, including
        Giotto di Bondone. Schools of art began to emerge throughout France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, and other
        parts of Europe.</p>

    <h2 id="rennaissance">The Renaissance Era (1420-1520): The Reawakening of an Art Era That Never Really Existed</h2>
    <p>The Renaissance era is possibly one of the most well-known, featuring artists like Michelangelo and Leonardo da
        Vinci. This era continued to focus
        on the individual human as its inspiration and took influence from the art and philosophy of the ancient Romans
        and Greeks. The Renaissance can be
        seen as a cultural rebirth.
        A part of this cultural rebirth was the returned focus on the natural and realistic world in which humans lived.
        The three-dimensional perspective
        became even more important to the art of the Renaissance, as is aptly demonstrated by Michelangelo’s statue of
        David. This statue harkened back to
        the works of the ancient Greeks as it was consciously created to be seen from all angles. Statues of the last
        two eras had been two-dimensional,
        intended to be viewed only from the front.</p>

    <p>The same three-dimensional perspective carried over into the paintings of the Renaissance era.
        Frescos that were invented around 3000 years prior were given new life by Renaissance painters.
        Scenes became more complex, and the representation of humans became much more nuanced.
        Renaissance artists painted human bodies and faces in three dimensions with a strong emphasis on realism.
        The paint used during the Renaissance period also represented a shift from tempera paints to oil paints.
        The Renaissance period is often credited as the very start of great Dutch landscape paintings.</p>


    <h2 id="mannerism">Mannerism (1520-1600): A Window into the Future of Kitsch</h2>
    <p>Of course, this heading is partly in jest. Not all of the art produced in this era is what we would understand
        today as “kitsch”.
        What we understand kitsch to mean today is often artificial, cheaply made, and without much ‘classic’ taste.
        Instead, the reason
        we describe the art of this period as being kitsch is due to the relative over-exaggeration that characterized
        it. Stemming from
        the newfound freedom of human expression in the Renaissance period, artists began to explore their own unique
        and individual
        artistic style, or manner.</p>
    <hr>
    <p style="color:rgb(97, 97, 96)">Michelangelo himself, in fact, is not free from the exaggeration that distinguishes
        this era. Some art historians do not consider some
        of his later paintings to be works of the Renaissance period. The expression of feelings and human gestures,
        even items of clothing,
        is exaggerated deliberately in mannerist paintings.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>The small S-curve of the human body that characterizes the Renaissance style is transformed into an unnatural
        bending of the body.
        This is the first European style that attracted artists from across Europe to its birthplace in Italy.</p>

    <h2 id="baroque">The Baroque Era (1590-1760): The Glorification of Power and the Deception of the Eye</h2>
    <p>The progression of art celebrating the lives of humans over the power of the divine continued into the Baroque
        era.
        Kings, princes, and even popes began to prefer to see their own power and prestige celebrated through art than
        that
        of God.
        The over-exaggeration that classified Mannerism also continued into the Baroque period,
        with the scenes of paintings becoming increasingly unrealistic and magnificent.</p>
    <hr>
    <p style="color:rgb(97, 97, 96)">Baroque paintings often showed scenes where Kings would be ascending into the
        heavens,
        mingling with the angels, and reaching
        ever closer to the divinity and power of God. Here, we really can see the progression of human self-importance,
        and
        although
        the subject matter does not move away entirely from religious symbolism,
        man is increasingly the central power within the compositions.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>New materials that glorify wealth and status like gold and marble become the prized materials for sculptures.
        Opposites of light and dark, warm and cold colors, and symbols of good and evil are emphasized beyond what is
        naturally occurring.
        Art academies increased in their numbers, as art became a way to display your wealth, power, and status.</p><br>

    <p>The paintings from the Rococo era are typical of the French aristocracy of the time. The name stems from the
        French
        word rocaillewhich means “shellwork”.
        The solid forms which characterized the Baroque period softened into light, air, and desire. Paintings of this
        era
        were no longerstrong and powerful, but light and playful.
        The colors were lighter and brighter, almost transparent in some instances. Many pieces of art from this period
        neglected religious themes, although some artists like Tiepolo did create frescos in many churches.</p>

                <h2>Classicism (1770-1840): Throwing It Back to Classic Times</h2>
                <p>Classicism, like the Rococo era, began in France in around 1770. In contrast to the Rococo era, however, Classism reverted to 
                    earlier, more serious styles of artistic expression. Much like the Renaissance period, Classisim took inspiration from classic
                     Roman and Greek art.
    
                    The art created in the Classicism era reverted to strict forms, two-dimensional colors, and human figures. The tone of these
                     paintings was undoubtedly strict. Colors lost their symbolism. The art produced in this era was used internationally to instill 
                     feelings of patriotism in the people of each nation. Parts of Classicism include Louis-Sieze, Empire, and Biedermeier.</p>

    <h2 id="Romanticism">Romanticism (1790-1850): A Break from the Severity of it All</h2>
    <p>You can see from the dates that this art era occurred at around the same time as Classicism. Romanticism is often
        seen as
        an emotionally charged reaction to the stern nature of Classicism. In contrast to the strict and realistic
        nature of the
        Classicism era, the paintings of the Romantic era were much more sentimental.</p>
    <hr>
    <p style="color:rgb(97, 97, 96);"><strong>The exploration of the intangible; emotions and the subconscious, took
            center-stage.
            Around this time, people began to go hiking in an attempt to explore the natural world. It was not, however,
            the true reality
            of the natural world which they intended to discover, but the way it made them feel</strong></p>
    <hr>
    <p>There is no tangible or precisely determinable style to the art of the Romanticism period. English and French
        painters tended
        to focus on the effects of shadows and lights, while the art produced by German painters tended to have more
        gravity of thought
        to them. The Romantic painters were often criticized and even mocked for their interpretation of the world
        around them.</p>
    <h2 id="Realism">Realism (1850-1925): Objectivity over Subjectivity</h2>
    <p>As the Romanticism era was a reactionary movement to the Classicism period before it, so is Realism a reaction to
        Romanticism.
        In contrast to the beautiful and deeply emotional content of Romantic paintings, Realist artists presented both
        the good and
        beautiful, the ugly and evil. The reality of the world is presented in an unembellished way by Realism painters.

    <hr>
    <p>Just as with Romanticism, Realism was not popular with everyone. The paintings are not particularly pleasing to
        the eye and some critics have commented that despite the artist’s claims of realism, erotic scenes somehow miss
        the real eroticism. Goethe criticizes Realism, saying that art should be ideal, not realistic. Schiller too
        calls Realism “mean,” indicating the harshness that many of the paintings portray.</p><br>

    <h2 id="Impressionism">Impressionism (1850-1895): Heralding the Era of Modern Art</h2>
    <p>Historians often paint the Impressionist movement as the beginning of the modern age. Impressionist art is said
        to have closed the book on classical music and other classical forms of art. Impressionism is also perhaps,
        after Cubism, one of the most easily recognizable art periods. Featuring artists like Claude Monet and Vincent
        van Gough, Impressionism broke away from the smooth brush strokes and areas of solid color that characterized
        many art periods before it.
    
        Initially, the word Impressionism was like a swear word in the art world, with critics believing that these
        artists did not paint with technique, but rather simply smeared paint onto a canvas. The brushstrokes indeed
        were a significant departure from those that came before them, sometimes becoming furiously wild. Distinct
        shapes and lines disappeared into a whirlwind of colors. Individual dots of completely new colors were put
        together, particularly in the pointillism variety of Impressionist paintings. The subjects of Impressionist
        paintings could often only be recognized from a distance.</p>

    <em>View of Vetheuil sur Seine (1880) by Claude Monet; Claude Monet, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons</em>
    <p>A significant change that occurred during the Impressionist era was that painting began to take place
        “en-plein-air,” or outside. Much of the Impressionist artist’s ability to capture the complex and ever-changing
        colors of the natural world were a result of this shift.
    
        Impressionist artists also began to move away from the desire to lecture and teach, preferring to create art for
        art’s sake. Galleries and international exhibitions became increasingly important.</p>

    <p>During this period, the era of Symbolism began to take hold in France. Artists became preoccupied with the
        representation of feelings and thoughts through objects. The favorite themes of the Symbolism movement were
        death, sickness, sin, and passion. The forms were mostly clear, a fact which art historians believe was
        anticipating the Art Nouveau era.</p>

    <h2 id="Art-Nouveau">Art Nouveau (1890-1910): The Pure Gold of Gustav Klimt</h2>
    <p>Although Gustav Klimt was by no means the most important artist in the Art Nouveau movement, he is one of the
        most well-known. His style perfectly encapsulates the Art Nouveau movement with soft, curved lines, lots of
        florals, and the stylistic characterization of human figures. In many countries, this style is known as the
        Secession style.</p>

    <em>The Kiss (1907-1908) by Gustav Klimt; Gustav Klimt, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons</em>
    <p>The art produced in the Art Nouveau period includes a lot of symmetry and is characterized by playfulness and
        youthfulness. Art Nouveau has a lot of political content, although many critics ignore this and hold the
        decorative aspects against it. Through the art of the Art Nouveau period, artists attempted to bring nature back
        into industrial cities.</p>
    <h2 id="Expressionism">Expressionism (1890-1914): Bringing a Political Edge to the Debate</h2>
    <p>In the Expressionism art era, we once again see a resurgence of the importance of the expression of subjective
        feelings. The artists within this movement were not interested in naturalism or what things look like on the
        outside. As a result, there is a certain tinge of aggression in some Expressionist paintings, which are often
        archaic and slightly wild.</p>
    <hr>
    <p style="color:rgb(97, 97, 96);"><strong>Expressionism originated in Germany and is intended to contrast
            Impressionism. Towards the beginning of the First World War, Expressionist paintings had a disturbing
            intensity about them. Intended to criticize power and the standing social order, Expressionism spread these
            political ideas through the medium of paint. Art was beginning to become political.</strong></p>
    <hr>
    <h2 id="Cubism">Cubism (1906-1914): Breaking Things Apart and Putting Them Back Together Again</h2>
    <p>Beginning with two artists, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque, the Cubist movement was all about fragmentation,
        geometric shapes, and multiple perspectives. The dimensional planes of everyday objects were broken down into
        different geometric segments and put back together in a way that presented the object from multiple sides
        simultaneously.
        Cubism was a rejection of all the rules of traditional western painting and has had a strong influence on the
        styles of art that have followed it.

    <h2 id="Futurism">Futurism (1909-1945): Artistic Anarchism</h2>
    <p>Futurism is less of an artistic style and more of an artistically inspired political movement. Founded by Tommaso
        Marinetti’s Futurist Manifesto, which rejected social organization and Christian morality, the Futurist era was
        full of chaos, hostility, aggression, and anger. Although Marinetti was not a painter himself, painting became
        the most prominent form of art within the Futurist movement.
    
        These artists vehemently rejected the rules of Classical painting, believing that everything that was passed
        through generations (beliefs, traditions, religion) was suspicious and dangerous. The militant nature of the
        Futurist movement has resulted in many people believing that it was too close to fascism.

    <h2 id="Dadaism">Dadaism (1912-1920): The True Reality That Life is Nonsense</h2>
    <p>Dada means a great many things and nothing at all. The writer Hugo Ball discovered that this small word has
        several different meanings in different languages and at the same time, as a word, it meant nothing at all. The
        Dadaism movement is based on the concepts of illogic and provocation and was seen as not only an art movement,
        but an anti-war movement.
        The illogic of existing rules, norms, traditions, and values was called into question by the Dadaist movement.
        The art movement encompassed several art forms including writing, poetry, dance, and performance art. Part of
        the movement was to call into question what could be classified as “art”.

    <p style="color:rgb(97, 97, 96);"><strong>Dadaism represents the beginnings of action art in which painting becomes

    <h2 id="Surrealism">Surrealism (1920-1930): Things Just Get More Bizzare</h2>
    <p>As if the pure illogic nature of the Dadaism movement was not outlandish enough, the Surrealists took the dream
        world to be the fountain of all truth. One of the most famous Surrealist artists is Salvador Dali, and you are
        bound to know his painting Melting Watch (1954).
    
        Surrealism is fundamentally psychoanalytical, and many Surrealist artists would paint directly from their
        dreams. Sometimes dealing with uncomfortable concepts, hidden desires, and taboos, Surrealism was a direct
        critique of the ingrained ideas and beliefs of the bourgeoise. As you can imagine, this style of art was not
        popular when it began, but it has greatly influenced the world of modern art.</p>

        New
        Objectivity movement turned towards these ideas. Many of the themes within New Objective art were social
        critiques.
        The turbulence of the war left many people searching for some kind of order to hold onto, and this can be seen
        clearly in the art of New Objectivity.</p>

    <p>Abstract Expressionism is said to be the first art movement to originate outside of Europe. Emerging from NorthAmerica, Abstract Expressionism focused on color-field painting and action paintings. Rather than using a canvas and a brush, buckets of paint would be poured on the ground, and artists used their fingers to create images.With well-known artists like Marc Tobey and Jackson Pollock, this art movement was distinct from any that came before it. The application of the paint was sometimes so thick that the finished piece would take on a form unlikeany painting before it. Abstract Expressionism spread throughout Europe. As with all art, there are alwayscritics,with conservative Americans during the cold war calling it “un-American.”</p>

Pop-Art developed simultaneously in the United States and England and is characterized by uniform  blocks of color and clear lines and contours. Painting and graphic art became influenced by photorealism and serial
        prints. One of the most famous English Pop artists is David Hockney, although only a few of his lifetime
        paintings
        were in this movement.</p>

        Berlin was a central point for this new movement, and the designs typically featured cities and big-city life.
        The name Neo-Expressionism emerged from Fauvism, and although the artists in Berlin disbanded in 1989, some
        artists continued to paint in this style in New York.</p>
